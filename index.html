          xcr.pt <i>(pronounced excerpt)</i> is a small sharp tool we hope you'll find useful every
          day. It allows you to select some text, or an image, press a button, and immediately get a
          permanent link to that content you can share with anyone, anywhere.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sans-serif f3 mb2 dib ttu tracked">How does that work?</h3>
        <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
          When you capture an excerpt, we ask your browser what you current selection is, collect a
          comment from you, and an archive of the page.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
          The archive is the exact state of your web browser recorded into a file. What's left
          behind is not the original page, it's sort of a 'preserved in formaldehyde' version. Very
          much dead, but unlikely to decay and easy to observe. We strip out all the Javascript,
          inline all the CSS and images, and keep the resulting code. Anything that was in your DOM
          at the moment of capture will be saved forever. Anything that wasn't, well, it isn't kept
          at all.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sans-serif f3 mb2 dib ttu tracked">Why not just use links?</h2>
        <p class="f5 f3-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
          Links change! The link you send today can show something else (or nothing at all)
          tomorrow. Links can show different information dependent on your recipient's location than
          when you sent it. A link can also require a login to see, one you might not want to share
          for all kinds of reasons.
